# AI_ACADEMIC_SCHEDULING_ADVISOR

## Project Title:
AI academic scheduling advisor


## Abstract:
One of the faculty's most significant tasks for tracking and directing students through their studies is academic advising. The academic advisor does a great effort to guide the students to the best scenarios for their academic journey, which can help them to increase their performance and their knowledge.
but this requires extremely time-consuming activities, as the academic advisor must review all student cases separately to define the available options and apply his expertise in offering effective advice for each student.


## Problem:
Many constraints put the student in a difficult and stressful situation that can lead to disastrous sequences and we need to address these problems and make the students' life simpler and easier. 
So now we will put most of the issues that can occur to the student with the pre-registration and its scheduling:
• Time conflicts.
• Pre-required courses. 
• Co-required courses.
• Difficulty of the courses.
• Maximum credit hours allowed in a term.
• Graduation year.
• Summer sessions.

Because of the previous points, many students make their plan in inappropriate way. According to a study conducted by the Zion center under the title (College Students Are Dropping Classes: How Often and Why): 
41% of students drop a class while they are a freshman or sophomore at a 4-year college or university, or in their first year at a 2-year community or junior college.

So, we can conclude that many students need an efficient and accurate tool for estimating course difficulty. This helps them choose the most appropriate plan according to their academic level.

## Solution:
This project introduces a system that uses artificial intelligence concepts and methods to analyze students' academic performance to produce study plans that are appropriate for each student's performance.
Students enter their academic performance data, and several parameters for each student, to be reused by the system to provide the best possible study plan for each student so that the student can graduate in the least possible number of semesters and the highest GPA.
When the system prepares a plan for a student, the system analyzes the performance of students who previously studied the remaining courses for the student. Through the results of this analysis, the system re-weighs the courses and then determines the most appropriate plan for the student’s study trip.
